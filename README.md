This project involves using the forward noise image from DDPM as the input for DIP.


## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution 

```bash
python main.py
```

## Demo

Without time step noise :

I have found that using noise images generated by the forward process in DDPM leads to better learning outcomes for DIP on average. It is speculated that the model can learn image features more effectively from different levels of noise, as the original DIP only uses noise images from a Gaussian distribution as input for the backward process.
